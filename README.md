# TwitterProject
Investigating geometry on twitter

This Repo consists of a series of scripts which call Twitter API endpoints to scrape data. 

To run scrapes, execute the setup.bash file with the scrape script of choice as the argument. Must also add bearer tokens (I have truncated mine).

Data is written to two files named D_data.csv and G_data.csv. These can be subsequently analysed using analysis.py by inputting the file names as the Dfile and Gfile variables in the Main.
